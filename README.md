# **ixo Oracles Base Repository**

Welcome to the **ixo Oracles Base Repository**—a comprehensive, modular framework for building and deploying AI-driven oracles. This repo consolidates essential modules (data storage, vector search, knowledge management, authentication, client SDK, real-time events, etc.) into a single, well-structured codebase. Whether you’re creating a new oracle from scratch or extending existing solutions, this repository provides the tooling and best practices to streamline development.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **Modular Architecture**  
   Each major function (e.g., Data Store, Vector DB, Knowledge Module, Auth, Events) is in its own package for easy maintenance and reuse.

2. **High Test Coverage**  
   Emphasis on automated testing to ensure reliability and maintainability. Certain core modules aim for **100% coverage**, while others target **75%+**.

3. **Flexible Integrations**  
   - **Data-Store** integrates seamlessly with structured data sources (e.g., Airtable).  
   - **Vector DB** modules (Chroma, Pinecone) support embedding-based search and retrieval.  
   - **Knowledge Module** centralizes domain-specific data, easily syncable with external sources.

4. **Client SDK**  
   Formerly `@ixo/oracles-ui`, now refactored as a **generic** SDK for interactive oracle sessions, dynamic UI rendering, and real-time communication.

5. **Security & Auth**  
   An **Auth module** ensures that oracles only perform actions when properly authorized, keeping user data secure.

6. **Real-Time Events**  
   The **Events module (`@ixo/oracles-events`)** facilitates event-driven communication between different parts of the system (and between backend and frontend) over WebSockets, making it easy to build reactive, real-time features.

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone or Fork the Repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ixoworld/ixo-oracles-boilerplate
   cd ixo-oracles-boilerplate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   (Alternatively, use `npm install` or `yarn install` if preferred.)

3. **Build the Project**  
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
   This compiles the TypeScript packages into distributable artifacts.

4. **Run Tests**  
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```
   - Includes both unit and (where implemented) integration tests.  
   - Coverage reports can be generated to maintain quality standards.

## **Usage & Modules**

Below is a quick overview of each major module. More detailed instructions are in each package’s local `README`.

1. **Auth Module**  
   - **Purpose:** Validates whether an oracle is authorized to perform actions for a user.  
   - **Usage:** Integrate permission checks (e.g., `checkPermission(user, action)`) in your service layer.

2. **Data-Store Module**  
   - **Purpose:** Provides a straightforward CRUD interface, often used with Airtable or other structured data sources.  
   - **Usage:** Import the `IDataStore<T>` interface and implement your logic (create, read, update, delete).

3. **Knowledge Module**  
   - **Purpose:** Manages domain-specific knowledge, syncing data between structured sources (Airtable) and vector stores if needed.  
   - **Usage:** Call the module’s CRUD functions to update or retrieve knowledge items.

4. **Vector DB Module**  
   - **Purpose:** Abstracts embedding-based search and retrieval with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma).  
   - **Usage:** Implement the `IVectorDB<T>` interface in your chosen DB package. Store or query embeddings seamlessly.

5. **Oracles Client SDK**  
   - **Purpose:** Provides hooks and components for real-time AI interactions (sessions, dynamic UI, message streaming).  
   - **Usage:** Wrap your React app in `UseOraclesProvider` for centralized config, then use hooks like `useAskOracle`.

6. **Events Module (`@ixo/oracles-events`)**  
    - **Purpose:** Offers a robust event management system, powered by `eventemitter2` and `socket.io`, to enable real-time, event-driven communication across services and between backend and frontend.  
      - **Usage:**  
        - **Create custom events** that extend a base class for consistent validation and structure.  
        - **Register events** in a central `GraphEventEmitter` to allow them to be emitted and listened for over WebSockets.  
        - **Emit events** when critical actions occur (e.g., new data stored, tool invocation, or UI updates).  
      - **Benefits:**  
        - Decouples modules and microservices through asynchronous notifications.  
        - Simplifies real-time features, providing a central point to register and manage events.  
      - For a detailed walkthrough (creating events, registering them, emitting, and listening), see the package’s **README** in [`packages/oracles-events`](https://github.com/ixoworld/ixo-oracles-boilerplate/tree/main/packages/events).

---

## **Configuration**

- **Environment Variables & Secrets**:  
  Each package may rely on environment variables (e.g., Airtable API keys, vector DB credentials). Provide them in a `.env` file or through a secure vault service.
  
- **Provider-Based Approach** (e.g., `UseOraclesProvider` for the client SDK):  
  - Pass all relevant configuration (API URLs, auth tokens) in one place, reducing duplication and simplifying maintenance.

---

## **Testing & Coverage**

- **Unit Tests**: Each package includes or will include basic unit tests.  
- **Integration Tests**: Certain workflows (e.g., Knowledge Module syncing Airtable + Vector DB) may have additional tests in the `tests/` folder.  
- **Coverage Goals**:  
  - **Core Modules**: 100% if possible (session management, core oracles logic).  
  - **Others**: ~75% coverage to ensure stability.  

Use `pnpm test:coverage` (or a similar script) to generate coverage reports.

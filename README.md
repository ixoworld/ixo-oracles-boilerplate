# IXO Oracles Framework

![IXO Oracles Framework](./cover.jpg)

A powerful framework for building and deploying **Agentic Oracles** on the IXO network. Built on **LangGraph**, **Matrix**, and **NestJS**, this framework enables developers to create intelligent oracles with secure communication, complex conversation flows, and automatic marketplace integration.

## What Makes This Special?

- **üîê Secure by Design**: Every user-oracle interaction happens in private, end-to-end encrypted Matrix rooms
- **üß† LangGraph Native**: Pure LangGraph implementation for building complex AI conversation flows
- **‚ö° Zero-Config Deployment**: Deploy once, instantly available in the IXO marketplace with full SDK support
- **üîó Blockchain Native**: Each oracle is a registered entity on the IXO blockchain with configurable parameters

## Prerequisites

- **IXO Account**: You must have a IXO account on the IXO mobile app
- **Node.js**: Version 22+ (see `.nvmrc` for exact version)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 10+ (required for workspace management)

## üöÄ Quick Start

**üö® IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** use the [IXO Oracles CLI](https://github.com/ixoworld/ixo-oracles-cli) to create oracles. The CLI handles all the complex setup including environment variables, and publishing to the IXO marketplace.

You can start with the IXO Oracles CLI:

```bash
npm install -g ixo-oracles-cli
```

Then create a new project:

```bash
oracles-cli --init
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Manual setup is only for advanced users who want to understand the framework internals. For production oracles, always use the CLI.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ixoworld/ixo-oracles-boilerplate
cd ixo-oracles-boilerplate

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Start development
cd apps/app
pnpm start:dev
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This framework creates a seamless bridge between **React applications**, **AI conversation flows**, and the **IXO blockchain**. Each oracle becomes a verified, living entity with its own **Matrix account** and **IXO account** that are registered on the blockchain entity. This allows users to verify oracle authenticity while maintaining complete **data ownership** - all conversation data belongs to the user, stored in their private, encrypted Matrix rooms.

**Optional Memory Engine Integration**: Agentic oracles can optionally integrate with the **IXO Memory Engine** (Neo4j-based) to provide personalized AI experiences by analyzing user patterns, storing key moments, and adapting response styles based on user preferences and conversation history.

**Knowledge Management**: The framework includes a comprehensive knowledge management system that provides AI oracles with access to structured and unstructured data sources. This enables context-aware conversations through semantic search, document storage, and dynamic knowledge retrieval. See [Knowledge Management Architecture](./docs/architecture/knowledge.md) for detailed information.

### 1. Runtime Message Processing Flow

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: First interaction must be through the **web portal** where users grant required **AuthZ permissions** to the oracle and ensure they have an active **subscription**.

> **üì± Matrix/Slack Access**: Matrix clients (Element, etc.) and Slack bots can only connect **after** the user has completed their first interaction through the web portal.

### The Magic: Zero-Config Integration

When you deploy an oracle built with this framework:

1. **Blockchain Registration**: Oracle entity registered on IXO with configs (via CLI)
2. **Oracle Identity**: Each oracle gets **Matrix account** + **IXO account** linked to blockchain entity
3. **Verifiable Agentic Oracles**: Users can verify oracle authenticity through blockchain records
4. **Instant SDK Access**: Any React app can connect using `@ixo/oracles-client-sdk`
5. **User Data Ownership**: Private Matrix rooms belong to users - **you own your data**
6. **LangGraph Ready**: Your conversation flows run immediately
7. **Complete Privacy**: All interactions stored in user's encrypted Matrix rooms

# Events System Architecture

## ðŸ“– Overview

The `@ixo/oracles-events` package is the real-time communication backbone of the IXO Oracles Framework. It handles streaming communication between your oracle (server) and client applications through Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSocket (WS) connections.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Real-time Tool Execution Updates**: Stream tool call status to clients
- **Dynamic UI Component Rendering**: Render custom React components from LLM responses
- **Browser Tool Calls**: Execute tools directly in the user's browser (reverse tool calls)
- **Session Management**: Automatic isolation and request tracking
- **Type-Safe Communication**: Full TypeScript support with payload validation

# Getting Started with IXO Oracles Framework

Welcome to the IXO Oracles Framework! This guide will walk you through building and deploying your first AI-powered oracle on the IXO network.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Build

We will be building a simple oracle that can do a general conversation with the user.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] Node.js 22+ installed
- [ ] pnpm 10+ installed (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- [ ] IXO account on the mobile app
- [ ] Basic understanding of TypeScript/JavaScript
- [ ] Familiarity with LangGraph

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install IXO Oracles CLI

```bash
npm install -g ixo-oracles-cli
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Oracle

```bash
# Create a new oracle project
oracles-cli --init

# Follow the interactive prompts from the CLI

```

#### Open your favorite code editor and start building your oracle

1. add to the `.env` file your api keys for `OpenRouter` ...etc.
2. Finally run the app and open web portal(dev-net) to test your app

### Step 3: Deploy with Docker

Your project comes with a ready-to-deploy `Dockerfile`. You can use this file to deploy your oracle to your own infrastructure as you like.

### Step 4: Test Your Oracle

After you have deployed your oracle, you can test it by opening the web portal(dev-net) and sending a message to your oracle and u can continue the conversation with the oracle in:

- Matrix
- Web Portal

Only the first time u use the oracle should be from portal so the client sdk can create your matrix room and grant the permissions to the oracle.

## ðŸ§  Building Your First Oracle

### Define Your Oracle's Purpose

let's start with general conversation flow.

### Create LangGraph Conversation Flow

open `/apps/app/src/graph/nodes/chat-node/prompt.ts` and start defining your prompt.

from `apps/app/src/graph/index.ts` u can remove the `contextGatherNode` to simplify your first oracle flow.
this node is used to connect to the memory engine and get the recent context of the user.

### Add Custom Tools and Functions

refer to langgraph docs for more information on how to add custom tools and functions.

and add them to `apps/app/src/graph/nodes/tools-node/tools.ts`

### Run your oracle

run `pnpm start:dev` to start your oracle.

and open web portal(dev-net) to test your oracle. u can find your oracle in the marketplace or when u ran the cli it should have listed the link for the oracle on the web portal
